# Progress so far

We found a dataset of dental images from the Univsersity of East Finland that we will use to train our machine learning model. The dataset contains 40gb of professional .tif images from dental exams with corresponding .csv files providing descriptive data about the images.

In this image is a Numerical Python (NumPy) array that represents an image from the dataset we found. A NumPy array is a datatype that is beneficial for data processing and manipulation and any type of image file can be turned into one. As we train our Machine Learning Model to identify dental issues, we will convert dataset images into NumPy arrays to maximize efficiency.

The example in the screenshot was created using the python NumPy library.
